# quack-bot user's guide

Welcome to the quack-bot alpha test!

ðŸš€ Quick Start ðŸš€
- install the quack-bot app in github, granting permission on all repositories you'd like to use it with
- create an issue in a repository that explains what work you want done
- IMPORTANT: when you create an issue for quack-bot, include the names of any relevant files in the repository; if you don't, quack-bot won't consider those files at all
- assign the issue to the quack-bot user (automatically added to your repositories on app installation)
- wait a moment for a pull request to arrive

NOTES:
- you can also leave review notes on a pull request and assign it to quack-bot for revision
- quack-bot recognizes issues on assignment; if you're not getting a reaction try to unassign and reassign quack-bot

Considerations:
  - if you're not sure how to do a thing because you don't know some syntax or some API then quack-bot can help you
  - if you're not sure how to do a thing because you don't really know what you should do, quack-bot is going to help you make a mess - go spend some time thinking first!
